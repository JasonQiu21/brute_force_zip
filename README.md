# Password-Protected Zip File Brute Forcer
(project for Fedora Project Google Code-in 2019-2020)

A program that uses python to brute force a password-protected zip file given a wordlist.

## Example
Here, we have a zip called `myfile.zip` with password `pass123`. We pass that and wordlist `rockyou(abridged).txt` and the script extracts the file, and shows what password it used to get it.
